We are excited to announce that our latest research titled "Beyond Robustness: Learning Unknown Dynamic Load Adaptation for Quadruped Locomotion on Rough Terrain" has been accepted by ICRA 2025.
<!--more-->

This work explores a novel approach to enable quadruped robots to adapt to unknown dynamic loads while traversing rough terrains, using only proprioceptive sensing. By proposing a general load modeling method and integrating it to the proposed RL training framework, our method significantly improves the robot's ability to stabilize loads and maintain balance on complex terrains.
