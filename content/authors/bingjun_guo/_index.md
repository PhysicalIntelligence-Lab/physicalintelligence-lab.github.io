# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I'm a research assistant at Phi Lab @ iZJU. It seems that I will focus on energy-based models (EBMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and their applications to control problems in the short run. As a process towards an a-little-bit-longer-term goal, I'm learning math and insights from computational neural & cognitive science, and trying my best not to fall asleep.
