My name is Feiyang Wu, a Computational Science and Engineering(CSE) Master student
at Harvard University. I obtained my bachelor's degree from both Zhejiang University-Univeristy and University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2025 and collaborated with Phisical Intelligence Lab during my undergraduate study.

Currently I am seeking job and research opportunities in the United States. I am particularly interested in the fields of manipulation and VLA for action generation.
