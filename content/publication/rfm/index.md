# abstract: 
# Thanks to recent explosive developments of data-driven learning methodologies, reinforcement learning (RL) emerges as a promising solution to address the legged locomotion
# problem in robotics. 

# In this letter, we propose CTS, a novel Concurrent Teacher-Student reinforcement learning architecture for legged locomotion over uneven terrains. Different from conventional teacher-student architecture that trains the teacher policy
# via RL first and then transfers the knowledge to the student pol-
# icy through supervised learning, our proposed architecture trains
# teacher and student policy networks concurrently under the rein-
# forcement learning paradigm. To this end, we develop a new training scheme based on a modified proximal policy gradient (PPO)
# method that exploits data samples collected from the interactions
# between both the teacher and the student policies with the environ-
# ment. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture and the new
# training scheme is demonstrated through substantial quantitative
# simulation comparisons with the state-of-the-art approaches and
# extensive indoor and outdoor experiments with quadrupedal and
# point-foot bipedal robot platforms, showcasing robust and agile
# locomotion capability. Quantitative simulation comparisons show
# that our approach reduces the average velocity tracking error by up
# to 20% compared to the two-stage teacher-student, demonstrating
# significant superiority in addressing blind locomotion tasks.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: This paper presents a novel RCM mechanism, which contains a parallel manipulator and a parallelogram structure to create a re-localizable RCM point that can be generalized over a range of procedures.
